            <p>The Taj Mahal is a symbol of love, harmony, purity, and spirituality, and some say it conveys a message about the importance of love and peace. <br> The design was intended to be an earthly replica of <strong>Mumtaz Mahal's house</strong> in paradise.</p><br>

            <h3><strong>Key Features</strong></h3>
            <ol>
                <dt>Architecture:</dt><br>
                <dd>The Taj Mahal is a white marble structure with a rectangular base, minarets at each corner, and a large dome with a lotus motif. The lower portion of the building is square and 32 meters high, and the interior has octagonal chambers connected by diagonal passages. The walls are decorated with Quran verses and floral patterns, and the building is surrounded by gardens, fountains, and pools</dd><br>
                <dt>Optical Illusion:</dt><br>
                <dd>The Taj Mahal was designed to create an optical illusion, making it appear large and close when you enter the gate, but smaller as you get closer</dd><br>
                <dt>Symetry:</dt><br>
                <dd>The building is perfectly symmetrical, with two identical minarets flanking the main tomb, and the complex is surrounded by a reflecting pool.</dd><br>
                <dt>Color:</dt><br>
                <dd>The Taj Mahal's white marble can change color throughout the day, appearing as a pastel pink in the sun and weather</dd><br>
                <dt>Tombs:</dt><br>
                <dd>The Taj Mahal's central tombs are empty, as Shah Jahan and Mumtaz Mahal are actually buried in unmarked tombs below. The tombs are enclosed in an eight-sided chamber with a marble lattice screen and pietra dura inlay. </dd><br>
